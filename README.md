# TOL

[![Build Status](https://github.com/gvdr/TOL.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/gvdr/TOL.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

A quick and dirty implementation of TOL time representation, in pure Julia.

To install the yet unregistered packages 

```julia
julia>] add https://github.com/gvdr/TOL.jl
```

## What's in the package

For the moment we have just some bare structures, types, and functions that come from the TOL ideas.

The **calendarization** is dynamic, and it is lifted from `Dates.TimeType`: this means that we can use `Date` (i.e., "2023-06-23"), `Time` (i.e., "12:33:08.336"), or `DateTime` (i.e., "2023-06-23T02:03:08.336").

There are, for the moments, three kinds of fechados, namely:
-   Day_of_Month: a `Day_of_Month(4)` includes all dates (or datetimes) that are on the 4th day of a month (i.e., all days like "yyyy-mm-04").
-   Day_of_Week: a `Day_of_Week(4)` includes all dates (or datetimes) that are on the 4th day of a week (i.e., Thursdays).
-   Month_of_Year:  a `Month_of_Year(4)` includes all dates (or datetimes) that are on the 4th Month of a year (i.e., April).

We have **operators** working on date (or datetimes) and fechados.
- âˆˆ : This is most fundamental operator, as it fundamentally defines the fechados, determing whether a certain date is in it or not. The converse operator âˆ‹ comes for free ðŸ˜„
- âˆ© and âˆª: creates respectively intersections and unions of fechados. The resulting objects are of type `IntFechado` and `UnFechado` respectively. Composition happens from the left: `Day_of_Week(1) âˆ© Day_of_Month(1) âˆ© Month_of_Year(1)` is the same of `((Day_of_Week(1) âˆ© Day_of_Month(1)) âˆ© Month_of_Year(1))`. We also have the convenience constructor functions `IntFechados()` and `UnFechados()` that work with arrays fechados (i.e., `IntFechados([Day_of_Week(1), Day_of_Month(1), Month_of_Year(1)])`).
- `succ()` and `prec()` : these functions returns either successors or predecessors of **dates** or **fechados**. The last argument is always compulsory, and it is the number of succ (or prec) steps to take.

## Examples

```julia
using TOL
using Dates

today = now()

today âˆˆ Day_of_Week(1) âˆ© Day_of_Month(1) âˆ© Month_of_Year(1)

today âˆˆ Day_of_Week(4) âˆª Day_of_Week(5)

succ(Month_of_Year(1),1)
prec(Month_of_Year(1),2)

succ(today,Month_of_Year(1),2)
```

## Extension

A fechado is defined by three main object:
- a struct inhering from `AbstractFechado`, providing the necessary information and (eventually) defining range of viability:
    ```julia
    struct Month_of_Year <: AbstractFechado
        n::Int
        Month_of_Year(n) = n > 12 || n < 0 ? error("The month of the year can not be negative nor greater than 12") : new(n)
    end
    ```
- a method for the inclusion function, âˆˆ, determining whether a date is in a fechado or not:
    ```julia
    function âˆˆ(a_date::Tt,a_Month_of_Year::Month_of_Year)::Bool where  {Tt<:TimeType}
        is_in = month(a_date) == a_Month_of_Year.n ? true : false
        return is_in
    end
    ```
- a collection of `succ()` functions, determing what comes next:
    ```julia
    succ(a_date::Tt,T::Month_of_Year,k) where {Tt<:TimeType} = a_date + Month(k)
    function succ(T::Month_of_Year,k)
        new_n = mod((T.n + k),12)
        new_n = new_n == 0 ? 12 : new_n
        return Month_of_Year(new_n)
    end
    ```

For convenience, we keep them all in `src/Fechados`.
